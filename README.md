# Song Lyrics Finder

**TODO**

Leverage Musixmatch API to create an interactive CLI app that allows the user to key in
a search query of a song.

If the song is found on [Musixmatch](https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation) database, please display
the lyrics to the user.

Give the user a menu where they can choose to search or view saved song lyrics.

You can ask a user whether they want to save their search results. If so, store the lyrics
in a local SQLite database.
